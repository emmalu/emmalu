# Hello, world! :wave:

**Bienvenidos & thanks for visiting...**

I'm a geospatial professional, software developer & general tech enthusiast. <br/>
I love working with data, making useful things, and learning while doing.

My background spans a variety of languages, technologies and tools, including:
- Javascript (Vanilla, `React`, and a touch of `Svelte`) for frontend projects
- Python (& a little PHP) for automation and backend development
- SQL (MS SQL Server & PostgreSQL)
- The ArcGIS Platform

That said, I've transitioned to the world of open-source, and I'm happy to be "here". :rocket:
