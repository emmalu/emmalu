# Hello, world! :wave:

**Bienvenidos & thanks for visiting...**

I'm a geospatial professional, software developer & general tech enthusiast. <br/>
I love working with data, making useful things, and learning while doing.

My background spans a variety of languages and technologies, including:
- Javascript (Vanilla, `React`, and a _touch_ of `Svelte`) for frontend projects
- Python (& a little PHP) for automation, backend development & notebooks
- SQL (MS SQL Server & PostgreSQL) - including geospatial data analysis & aggregations
- The ArcGIS Platform (up to v10.x)

That said, I've discovered the world of open-source, and I'm thankful & happy to be "here". :rocket:
