# Hello, world! :wave:

## Bienvenidos & thanks for visiting...

I'm a geospatial professional, software developer & general tech enthusiast. <br/>
I love working with data, making useful things, and the practice of learning while doing.


### My background
... spans a variety of languages and technologies, including:
- The `ArcGIS` Platform (up to v10.x)
- `Javascript` (Vanilla, `React`, and a _touch_ of `Svelte`) for frontend projects with and without maps
- `Python` (& a little PHP) for automation, data pipelines, backend API development, IaC maintenance
- `SQL` for geospatial data analysis & aggregations
- `OGC` and `STAC` standards


### How did I get here?

My journey started in grad school, when I discovered scientific data analysis through the captivating lens of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I spent the first part of my career developing _spatial reasoning skills_ and _dabbling in programming_ while building practical GIS tools using commercial software. Most of my experience has come in roles supporting local governments and non-profit organizations.

I've since followed "an itch" to explore the world of open-source software, and I've been fortunate to be able to do so while building and maintaining geospatial tools that support Earth Science research. :rocket:
